# Contract

The contract was build in Ropsten Network and the address is: *0xb38B6F0F7b77Df0fa718776eba940d524eABAD0d*
I did some testing in ganache before using Ropsten network. 

## Compiler

The contract was compiled in Remix IDE and testing there, all frontend and backend it's use with javascript usign web3 library to get values from the contract like the highest player and the amount of the highest player.

## Frontend

I decided to use Bootstrap with containers and some structure in the HTML, but I made my own css rules to demostrate my skills in CSS too.

The link for the contract in the eth scan its : https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb38B6F0F7b77Df0fa718776eba940d524eABAD0d
It's says that is one contract with the same amount of bytes but that was my first deployed smart contract, sorry for that I didn't know it that I deployed in testnet before
