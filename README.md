# Pay To Vote by: Cristian Hernandez

Hi, I'm Cristian and this is my simple dapp to develop a contrat that allows to contribute an amout and be the winner in a pay to vote game, basically if you are the highest voter you can't contribute more, only if other player contribute more eth.


# Contract

The contract was build in Ropsten Network and the address is: *0xb38B6F0F7b77Df0fa718776eba940d524eABAD0d*
I did some testing in ganache before using Ropsten network. 

## Compiler

The contract was compiled in Remix IDE and testing there, all frontend and backend it's use with javascript usign web3 library to get values from the contract like the highest player and the amount of the highest player.

## Frontend

I decided to use Bootstrap with containers and some structure in the HTML, but I made my own css rules to demostrate my skills in CSS too.
